 * Graphical representation of a world.

 * Contains all graphical assets needed to display the world. It contains a
 * graphical representation for all objects in the world that have one.
 * The world-surface manages all aspects of the assets. Loading them from disk,
 * and providing them to the application in different forms.
 * Clients of the world-surface can request assets in two forms:
 * - QSGTexture - used in the qquick scene-graph
 * - file path or url - used in directly creating QImages or passing it as
 *   image source to other components
 *
 * QSGTextures should only be used on the scene-graph rendering thread. The
 * world-surface takes care of creating and destroying them.
 * Paths and urls should only be used with Qt's file classes (QFile, QImage,
 * etc.).
 *
 * The world-surface also manages other information related to the visual
 * representation of the world, like the tile-size, border-colors, etc.
