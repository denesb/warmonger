# Warmonger

Warmonger is (will be) a turn based strategy game-engine inspired by
[Battle for Wesnoth](http://wesnoth.org),
[Heroes of Might and Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic),
the [Total War series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_War_(series)),
[Mount & Blade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_%26_Blade) and some other
strategy games mixed with my own ideas.

The project is under development and is not functional yet. As it is a pet
project and I work on it in my free time, I have no idea when it will be
anywhere near ready to use (if ever).

## Contributing

Warmonger doesn't have a roadmap yet, mainly because I'm still making up my
mind about some of the essential design decisions. Nevertheless if you are
interested feel free to drop me a line at dns dot botond at gmail dot com.

## Dependencies

 * [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) 3.1 (details still to be worked out)
