# Warmonger

Warmonger is (will be) a turn based strategy game inspired by [Battle for Wesnoth](http://wesnoth.org)
and some other strategy games mixed with my own ideas.

The game is intended to be easily modifiable and customizable, with clear documentation and code.

The project is under development and is not functional yet. As it is a pet project and I work on it in my free time,
I have no idea when it will be ready to use.
