 * - z depth-ordering, larger z values will be more to the foreground.
 * - parent the parent ebtity of this entity.
 *
 * Note:
 * Offsets are in pixels.
 * The parent allows entities to be organized in a tree. When the root
 * object changes position, all its children also change position
 * automatically. If the entity doesn't have a parent its position
 * component will be used to determine the position. If it doesn't have
 * a position component either it won't be rendered at all.
 * The path is meant to be an opaque handle to a graphic resource that
 * both the world-rules and the rendering layer understands.
