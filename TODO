Things to do until the first "usable" release.

General
-------
* Rethink the GamEntity setPath business. Currently, once loaded it cannot be
modified, but this might not be what we want.

Core
----
* Unit: update hp, mp, xp, when unit type changes.

Map Editor
----------
* When loading a map setup the search paths for the world surface.
* Make it possible to create new maps (the first node has to be created
automatically).
* Batch terrain editing and creation.
* Make it possible to move, or remove objects (settlements, units).
* Do not allow more than one settlement and unit per tile
* Handle switching between maps.

Map
---
* Center map on the canvas (if smaller than canvas).
* Repaint only those nodes overlapping or contained in the damage region.

MiniMap
-------
* Why are those gaps between the hexagons?

Gameplay (both core and ui)
---------------------------
* Base infrastructure (Game class, Game.qml).
* Recruit units.
* Unit movement.
* Battle.

UI
--
* Setup new game.
* Load saved game.
* Open maps for editing.
* Make the UI as whole look less awful.
* Add about menu.

Settings
--------
* Store preferred world surface.
* Store map and world search paths.
